### One issue or bug per Pull Request

Keep your Pull Requests small. Small PRs are easier to reason about which makes them significantly more likely to get merged.

### Issues before features

If you want to add a feature, please file an [Issue](issues) first. An Issue gives us the opportunity to discuss the requirements and implications of a feature with you before you start writing code.

### Forwards compatibility

Please do not write new code using deprecated APIs.
